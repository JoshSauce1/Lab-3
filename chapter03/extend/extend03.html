            <h3>Modifying Images</h3>

            <!-- 1st paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to explain the importance of using descriptive file names for image files. Use complete sentences. -->
            <p>Its important because you want to tell the search engine exactly what the image is about and
						descriptive file names are an important part of organizing, sharing, and keeping track of data files.</p>

            <!-- 2nd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the application you used to change the size of the image. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>I used the default photo application on my laptop to resize the picture, then saved it to the same file.</p>

            <!-- 3rd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the original size of the image, in pixels. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>The original size of the pixels was 2121 x 1414</p>

            <h4>Image Before Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image before compression, html5.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5.jpg" alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass" height="2121" width= "1414">

            <!-- 4th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the online image compressor you used to reduce the file size. What was the original image file size? What was the reduced image file size? Use complete sentences.  -->
            <p>I used compresser.io to reduce the file size.</p>

            <h4>Image After Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image after compression, html5_min.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html15_min.jpg" alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass" height="500" width= "333">

            <!-- 5th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to note any visual changes that you can see between html5.jpg and html5_min.jpg -->
            <p>There arent really that much noticable differences but it is a little more blurrier than before and smaller</p>

                <h3>SVG Graphics</h3>

                <!-- Insert your SVG code below this comment -->
								<svg width="100" height="100">
   						<circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="orange" stroke-width="4" fill="red" />
						</svg>

                <!-- 6th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to provide information about the resource you used to help create your SVG image -->
                <p>I used w3 schools and recreated a different circle out of the example that was on there.</p>
